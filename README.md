# Power-BI

This repository contains my Microsoft Power BI notes and projects. Currently I am only able use Power BI Desktop (Power BI service requires either a work or student email address to log in); therefore, I included screenshot images of the dashboards I created in Power BI Desktop. 

I first learned to use Power Query, DAX, and Power Pivot in Excel prior to learning Power BI. Creating and editing queries, calculated columns and DAX measures, and creating data models works the same way in Excel and Power BI, so if you learn one you can easily learn the other. From there, I learned to create dashboards in the Power BI report view using various charts and the wide range of options for formatting and filtering the visuals to create an impressive, interactive dashboard. I learned these skills from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/) Excel and Power BI courses, which I highly recommend!
